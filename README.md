## Story
I wanted to make this app better, plus improve my skills regarding dynamically creating html via js, for loops etc while also using an array splicer to prevent unlimited listed player scores.


## Installation
No installation, just plain ol Java Script, html and css.

## Usage
Just go to this app and start the quiz, once the game ends either time out our end of questions, enter your name, save and view high scores <a href="https://castroolympias.github.io/Count-down-code-quiz/"> Count-down quiz</a>
